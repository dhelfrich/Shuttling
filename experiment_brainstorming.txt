Experiment Brainstorm:

1) Gradient. Heat on one end, cold around. single beetle at one end. observe movement and steady state?

Thermal camera, how to cool environment (dry ice?), cardboard to insulate, power source to heat the metal rod. 

Talk to Harvey about solving 3D heat equation through glass, air, acrylic layers.

EXPERIMENTAL SETUP:

1) Arena set up with heater on one end (low watt density=long life). Keep the heater cool and have rapid heat transfer out of it.
-Establish temperature as a function of distance from heater.
- T(x)=Th-(Th-Tinf)*x/L if we are assuming steady state
- We should set up in a temperature controlled environment to make things consistent, ie a fridge
- heaters are available for this application that should be very reliable in terms of wattage density.
- How can we measure temperature at each location along the arena? Aquarium thermometers? Mini temperature probes?

CONTROL: Uniform temperature everywhere (a few different temps?)

2) Observe individual beetle in arena for some length of time (30mins?), taking pictures at regular intervals (15sec?)

3) Create input data for our function to run through.

4) Analyze
-Does our model correctly predict when a beetle moves?
-Do they end up in the right place eventually?
-Is there actually a predictable pattern to beetle movement or is it too stochastic?

Next ideas: use an "average beetle" rather than individuals to track movements.
